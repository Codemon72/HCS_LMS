work in progress: 
# Project for Hamburg Coding School: Learning Management System (Node.js)

In this Repo I was working on an App to fill and manage a database for courses, students and teachers for [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).
I started using a basic [tutorial from Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOHysWYMZM0&list=PLillGF-RfqbZyLc9sMQ72_u3FW9fVxo1p), customized it and expanded it's functionalities.
For scalibility (and fun ðŸ˜‰) I abandoned this project and started it with React.
